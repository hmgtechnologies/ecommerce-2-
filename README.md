## 📖 What is HMG StoreForge?

HMG StoreForge is a **platform that generates complete, ready-to-deploy online stores** for your
clients. You (the operator) enter a client's business details once, and StoreForge produces a full
e-commerce website — product catalog, shopping cart, WhatsApp ordering, payments, search, and an
admin panel — packaged into a ZIP you upload to GitHub / Cloudflare Pages.

Each generated store is similar in spirit to **Jumia, Jiji, and Konga**, but is a single-vendor
store owned by your client. Your client then uploads product photos (via **Google Drive links**),
adds prices and descriptions through an **admin panel**, and those products appear instantly on the
storefront for customers — who can pay and contact the seller via **WhatsApp or email**.

> 💡 **Lead generation built in:** Every store carries a *"⚡ Built with HMG StoreForge — Get your
> own store"* footer linking to your WhatsApp and HMG sites. Every client store becomes a permanent
> advertisement that brings you new business.

## 🧩 The Three Parts of the Platform

| Part | Folder | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1. The Generator** | `generator/` | Where YOU enter client details and download a finished store. Two ways: a browser form (`index.html`) and a Node.js CLI (`cli/generate.js`). |
| **2. The Store Template** | `store-template/` | The actual e-commerce website each client receives (storefront + admin panel). |
| **3. The Supabase Setup** | `supabase/` | Optional free database for live product/order management. |
| **4. The Demo Store** | `demo-store/` | A fully-populated, deployable example showing every feature. Open `demo-store/index.html`. |
| **5. Integrations** 🆕 | `integrations/` | Free Google Sheets order-logging (Apps Script) + setup guide. |

Full documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/).

---

## 🏠 Start here: open `index.html`

The package now includes a **root `index.html` landing page** — the platform's front door. Open it
(or deploy the whole folder) and it links you to the **Generator**, the **live Demo store**, the
**Store template**, and the **docs**, with HMG branding + WhatsApp for lead generation. Root-level
`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and `_redirects` are included so the package is deploy-ready at the root.

## ⚡ Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Option A — Browser, download ZIP (easiest, no install)
1. Open `generator/index.html` in any browser (or deploy it to Cloudflare Pages).
2. Fill in the client's details (name, WhatsApp, colours, payment info…).
3. Click **⚙️ Generate Store Files (ZIP)** → a ZIP downloads.
4. Unzip → upload contents to a GitHub repo → deploy on Cloudflare Pages.
5. Send the client their store link + admin passcode. Done.

### Option A2 — Browser, ONE-CLICK GitHub deploy 🆕 (fastest)
1. Open `generator/index.html`, fill the details.
2. In **🚀 One-Click Deploy to GitHub**, paste a GitHub token (see `docs/GITHUB-DEPLOY.md`).
3. Click **🚀 Generate & Deploy to GitHub** → it creates the repo, pushes files, enables Pages.
4. Copy the live URL from the log. Done in ~30 seconds.

### 👁️ Want to see it first? Open `demo-store/index.html` for a fully-populated live demo.

### Option B — Command line (for power users / batch generation)
```bash
cd e-commerce/generator/cli
node generate.js --init                 # creates client.sample.json
# edit client.sample.json with the client's details
node generate.js client.sample.json     # outputs dist/<storeId>/
```
